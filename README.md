# Type R-118
The Type R-118 Paraflex subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. and Patrick Sander, members of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

# About Paraflex
This Type R-118 sounds good with a low cost driver like the RCF LF18G401, but some other drivers can also be used like the 18Sound 18LW2400, 18LW1400, B&C 18TBW100, B&C 18NBC100, LaVoce SAF184.02/03. There is also a Type-R design for 21" drivers available. 

The subwoofer uses a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, which was named **Paraflex** for easy naming. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions. 

# Working range
The Type R-121 shall have a dimension of 600 x 700 x 1070 mm (wxhxd) and its tuning is around 40Hz (Fb). It's working range is from 35hz up to 120hz. We encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for midrange and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
